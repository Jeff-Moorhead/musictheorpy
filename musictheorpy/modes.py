# Modes - a mode is a note group, similar to a scale, but is based off of a certain degree of the corresponding scale.
# For example, D dorian is a C scale starting on D. So, one possible approach is to build the scale, find the degree
# that corresponds to the mode's 'tonic', then rearrange the notes in the scale to start on the mode's tonic. This
# will require adding a new method to scales to get the degree based on a given note. ---- Start there.
