I am always open to hearing people's ideas, so even if you don't want to contrinute, but still have a thought on how the
project can improve, please feel free to send me an email at **jeff.moorhead1@gmail.com** with your name, thoughts on
improving the library, and how I can best contact you to continue the discussion. I only ask that you be patient, as
