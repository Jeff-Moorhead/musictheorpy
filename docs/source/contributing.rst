Contributing
============

Musictheorpy is under active development and will grow to include new features in the future. If you are interested in
 contributing to the project, all you need to do is fork the Github repository, download the source code, and begin
 working. Continue to the complete guide below for more details. Even if you don't want to contribute directly,
I am always open to hearing people's ideas, so if you have a thought on how the project can improve, please
feel free to send me an email at jeff.moorhead1@gmail.com with your name, thoughts on improving the library, and
how I can best contact you to continue the discussion. I only ask that you be patient, as between work, graduate school,
and life, it may take me a few days to respond.

Setting Up Your Environment
---------------------------
The first step to contributing code to Musictheorpy is to fork the repository on Github.

.. TODO add image of Fork button on Github, or link to Github docs on forking

Once you have forked the repository, you can download the source code to a local Git repository.

.. TODO add link to Git docs on cloning

You will need to install Nose for the project. If you have Nose already installed globally, you can run ``nosetests``
from the project root directory to make sure all the tests pass as expected. If you do not have Nose, you can either
install it globally with ``pip install nose``, or create a virtual environment and install it there.

.. TODO add link to venv docs or virtualenv docs

The command to install Nose to a virtual environment is the same as to install it globally.

.. TODO add info about pull requests (research pull requests...)
