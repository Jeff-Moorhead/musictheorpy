Installation
============

Installing Musictheorpy is really easy! All you need to do is run ``pip install musictheorpy`` and you can begin using
the library right away. Or, if you do not want to use pip, you can also download the source code from Github (ADD URL)
and install the code directly from within the project root directory.
