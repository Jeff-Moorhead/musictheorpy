Installation
============

Installing Musictheorpy is really easy! All you need to do is run ``pip install musictheorpy`` and you can begin using
the library right away. Or, if you do not want to use pip, you can also download the source code from
`Github <https://github.com/Jeff-Moorhead/musictheorpy>`_ and install the code directly from within the project
root directory.
